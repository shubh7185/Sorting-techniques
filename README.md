# Sorting Techniques

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in different programming languages. Sorting algorithms are essential tools in computer science used to arrange elements in a specific order. Each sorting algorithm has its advantages, disadvantages, and ideal use cases.

## Implemented Sorting Algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort**:
   - Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. **Insertion Sort**:
   - Insertion sort is another comparison-based sorting algorithm. It builds a sorted sublist one element at a time by repeatedly taking the next element from the unsorted sublist and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted sublist.

3. **Merge Sort**:
   - Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input list into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce a single sorted list.

4. **Quick Sort**:
   - Quick sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm. It selects a pivot element from the list and partitions the other elements into two sublists according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sublists.

5. **Selection Sort**:
   - Selection sort is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist. It repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted sublist and moves it to the beginning of the sorted sublist.

6. **Shell Sort**:
   - Shell sort is an efficient sorting algorithm based on insertion sort. It starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. It is an improvement over insertion sort for large datasets.
